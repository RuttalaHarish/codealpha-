# CodeAlpha - CodeAlpha Data Science Internship Projects

Welcome to the "CodeAlpha" repository, which contains a collection of data science projects completed during the Data Science Internship at CodeAlpha. This repository showcases the practical skills and knowledge gained throughout the internship, covering a variety of topics in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling.

## Projects

### 1. Credit Scoring Model 
- File: credit scoring.py
- Description: In this project, we Use classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest.

### 2.  Disease Prediction from Medical Data 
- File: disease prediction
- Description: In this project, we Apply classification techniques to structured medical datasets and features like symptoms, age, blood test results, etc

### 3.  Emotion Recognition from Speech
- File: emotion recognation.py
- Description:  In this project, We apply deep learning and speech signal processing techniques and models like CNN, RNN, or LSTM.
